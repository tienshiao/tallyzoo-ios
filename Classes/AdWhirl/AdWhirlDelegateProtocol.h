 * When you are notified that an ad request failed, you are also informed if the
 * AdWhirlView is fetching a backup ad.  The backup fetching order is specified
 * by you in adwhirl.com or your own server instance.  When all backup sources
 * are attempted and the last ad request still fails, the usingBackup parameter
 * will be set to NO.  You can use this notification to try again and perhaps
 * request another AdWhirlView via [AdWhirlView requestAdWhirlViewWithDelegate:]

 * For example, you can replace the ad in AdWhirlView after getting this callback
